# wix-sync

The `Wix-sync` tool is used to sync data into a Wix Data / Content Manager website. 
The tool syncs database items and media files (images, videos, audio files or documents)
making them available in a wix data collection.

Wix Sync supports 2 modes of operations
* import only - which adds new items or updates existing items (matching by `_id`)
* sync - which, in addition to import, also removes all other items from the collection
