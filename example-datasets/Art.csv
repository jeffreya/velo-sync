The piece is over two storeys up and represents a woman falling with a trolley from the top of a building. Banksy’s aim was to point out the dangers of consumerism.  The mural was painted in November 2011 in broad daylight. A scaffolding and a tarpaulin were used to make sure nobody caught the artist red-handed. “Shop Till You Drop” is still visible and quite damaged.",0560c783-f374-44f6-b318-908d6de77816, Shop Till You Drop

The words ‘There Is Always Hope’ are written just behind a young girl, who can be seen reaching for a balloon in the shape of a heart. Intense debate has raged on over the years regarding the true meaning of this stencil, with a variety of ideas involving love, innocence and – obviously – hope",1c138979-d640-4d53-b390-187a4196db5f,There Is Always Hope

The mural, painted in 2009, represents a city worker covering the work of another graffiti artist painted in 1985 with grey wallpaper.  This wall became the battleground of a graffiti war between Banksy and the deceased London graffiti legend King Robbo. Shortly after, Robbo struck back and covered Banksy’s piece on the pretext that he broke the underground code of conduct. The wall undergone eight other modifications from both artists. The feud stopped when King Robbo was hospitalised for life-threatening head injuries. When Banksy heard about King Robbo’s serious health condition, he painted an ode to Robbo’s original graffiti piece. As a tribute to Robbo, the mural was restored to its original form with slight changes.",414c339e-0300-44b9-b8a4-376d8f0acbca, Graffiti Painter

Painted in 2008 on the side of a pharmacy, Banksy’s work depicts a group of three children pledging their allegiance to the British supermarket chain Tesco.  One of them is raising a flag composed by a Tesco carrier bag. Even though it was quickly covered in perspex, “Very Little Help” has been vandalised on several occasions and it is currently partially damaged. The flag has been painted over and replaced with a tag from Robbo.",696f7b91-cd61-4a6c-a5f8-06fe1e916354,Tesco Kids
